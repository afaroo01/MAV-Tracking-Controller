# MAV-Tracking-Controller

The objective of our work are as follows:

1. Implement an object tracking controller on a stm32 microcontroller in a 3-D space
from 2-D video frames, that is, to develop an algorithm able to follow the movement
of the target object through the imageâ€™s height, width and depth information coming
from the drone camera.

2. To control the drone maneuverability so that is follows the observations given by the
stm32 flight-controller algorithm, creating a target-tracking implementation for the
drone.

3. Verify and test the performance of the algorithm on a virtual open-source simulator
called AriSim.
